In addition this repository contains the two datasets that were used in case study 1 and case study 2. See for more information below.

Case study 1: Algae cover (andrew.csv)
This data was collected by Andrew and Underwood and the analysis was published in:
- Andrew, N. & Underwood, A. (1993) Density-dependent foraging in the sea urchin centrostephanus rodgersii on shallow subtidal reefs in new south wales, australia. Marine Ecology Press Series, 99, 89-98 and reanalysed by:
- Quinn, G. & Keough, M. (2002) Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. The data was retrieved from the website accompanying the book: https://qkstats.com/. We refer users to this website for copyright issues.

Case study 2: Proportion biomass allocated to stems, leaves and roots (R6data.csv).
This data was collected by Hendrik Poorter and co-workers and analyses were published in:
- Poorter, H., van de Vijver, C.A.D.M., Boot, R.G.A. & Lambers, H. (1995) Growth and carbon economy of a fast-growing and a slow-growing grass species as dependent on nitrate supply. Plant and Soil, 171, 217-227
