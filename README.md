The files in this repository are the source files of the supplementary material belonging to the above mentioned paper. In addition, two datasets are provided that were used in case study 1 and case study 2. 

Case study 1: Algae cover
This data was collected by Andrew and Underwood and the analysis was published in Andrew, N. & Underwood, A. (1993) Density-dependent foraging in the sea urchin centrostephanus rodgersii on shallow subtidal reefs in new south wales, australia. Marine Ecology Press Series, 99, 89-98 and reanalysed by Quinn, G. & Keough, M. (2002) Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. The data was retrieved from the website accompanying the book: https://qkstats.com/. We refer users to this website for issues on copyright.

Case study 2: Proportion biomass allocated to stems, leaves and roots.
This data was collected by Hendrik Poorter and co-workers and the analysis was published in Poorter, H., van de Vijver, C.A.D.M., Boot, R.G.A. & Lambers, H. (1995) Growth and carbon economy of a fast-growing and a slow-growing grass species as dependent on nitrate supply. Plant and Soil, 171, 217-227. Data can be used freely. In case you wish to do a biological re-analysis of the data, please contact the authors of the paper (Hendrik Poorter).
